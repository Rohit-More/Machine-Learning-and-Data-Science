Name: Polynomial Regression

Description: Polynomial regression is used in cases where the features and the target variabkes don't show a linear relationship but rather can be described using some other polynomial equations

Algorithm:

1) Import necessary libraries

2) Import dataset

3) Clean the data if required, remove all the redundant columns which can lead to leak in data and reduce the model performance

4) First, we build a polynomial features object which will transform the dataset to add the polynomial features

5) Next we build a linear regression object which will take the newly transformed features and the target varibales

6) We then print the predicted values
