Name:- Diabetes Dataset using Neural Networks

Description:- The given dataset is pre cleaned regression dataset which can be used to apply and practoce simple ML Models, so here the model is a basic Neural Network which is used to predict the values.

Algorithm:

1) We import the necessary libraries.

2) We load the dataset.

3) We split the dataset into training and testing dataset

4) We build the model

5) Compile the model with the help of compile method

6) Train the model with the help of fit method

7) We plot the loss vs epoch graph and the scatter plot to show the difference in the prediction and actual values
