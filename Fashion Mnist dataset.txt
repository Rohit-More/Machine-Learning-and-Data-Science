Name:- Fashion Mnist dataset 

Description: - Mnist dataset is a collection of black and white images which can be used to build a simple CNN to classify the images into 10 or more predefined classes

Algorithm:
1) Load the necessary libraries

2) Load the dataset

3) We build a list to store the labels or the pre defined classes 

4) Convert the images into a image arrays and change the dimensions

5) Then normalize the image arrays by dividing every pixel value by 255 to reduce them to 0-1

6) Then we build the model

7) Add the necessary optimizers

8) Fit the model with the training dataset

9) Print the loss vs epoch graphs

10) Then we print the predictions
